ASSIGNMENT TOPIC
You are creating a website to showcase your favourite music albums.
In this page you will have a short biography section of yourself, and the top albums of your life, 
the worst album you ever listened to and everything related to the music you love.

ASSIGNMENT RULES
- The project must be pushed to a new repository and linked in EduFlow by the end of the day.
- You can google / use StackOverflow BUT we suggest you to use just the material provided and documentation.
- To test the page, open it with your browser and inspect it with developer tools / device emulator.
- Use Bootstrap4.6 classes to create the page.
- Use containers, rows and cols in order to achieve a great responsive layout.

NOTE:
Even the most experienced designers need inspiration.
Spend some time surfing the web researching the best way of representing the albums you love.
Could be the Amazon way, the Spotify or Apple music way or any other music collection out there.

HINT: Manage your time in order to finish the structure and responsiveness before focusing on details.

                                <p>Loss, love, forced coming-of-age, and fragile generational hope: Arcade Fire’s debut
                                    touched on all these themes as it defined the independent rock of the ‘00s. Built on
                                    family ties (leader Win Butler, his wife, Régine Chassagne, his brother Will), the
                                    Montreal band made symphonic rock that truly rocked, simultaneously outsize and
                                    deeply
                                    personal, like the best pop. But for all its sad realism, Butler’s is music that
                                    still
                                    finds solace, and purpose, in communal celebration.</p>

                                <p>Fronted by Chaka Khan, one of soul music’s most combustible singers, Rufus built its
                                    mid-Seventies sound on heavy-footed, guitar-slathered funk. But after spending 16
                                    months in the studio working on Ask Rufus, they came out with a record that gave
                                    their songs more room to breathe, anticipating the lithe, loose arrangements of
                                    Nineties neo-soul. Khan glided through the head-nodding “Everlasting Love” and the
                                    twisty-turny “Better Days,” and fans appreciated the adjustment: Ask Rufus was the
                                    group’s first platinum record.</p>

                                <p>These New York synth-punks evoke everything from the Velvet Underground to
                                    rockabilly. Martin Rev’s low-budget electronics are violent and hypnotic; Alan Vega
                                    screams as a rhythmic device. Late-night listening to “Frankie Teardrop,” a
                                    10-minute-plus tale of a multiple murder, is not recommended. A droning voice in the
                                    wilderness when they appeared in the Seventies, the duo would influence bands from
                                    Arcade Fire and the National to Bruce Springsteen, who covered Suicide live in 2016.

                                <p>The greatest album ever to be marketed under the heading “world music,” this 1985
                                    compilation of South African pop was a huge influence on Paul Simon’s Graceland that
                                    still sounds jarringly fresh today. Full of funky, loping beats and gruff, Howling
                                    Wolf-style vocals (most prominently from “goat voiced” star Mahlathini). With a
                                    sweet track by Graceland collaborators Ladysmith Black Mambazo (“Nansi Imali”), its
                                    badass joy needed no translation.</p>

                                    pop charts, Shakira was a raven-haired guitar rocker who’d hit peak superstardom in
                                    the Spanish-speaking world with her 1995 LP, Pies Descalzos. To keep up the
                                    momentum, Shakira enlisted Emilio Estefan to help produce her next LP, this stellar
                                    globetrotting dance-rock set, which blends sounds from Colombia, Mexico, and her
                                    father’s native Lebanon.</p>

                                </h5>
                                <p>With their innocent romanticism and meticulous vocal arrangements, Boyz II Men became
                                    the most commercially successful R&B vocal group of all time. II includes two
                                    mammoth hits, courtesy of Babyface: “I’ll Make Love to You” and the audaciously
                                    baroque “Water Runs Dry.” But the group’s own Nathan Morris and Shawn Stockman
                                    composed II‘s most poignant moment, “Khalil’s Interlude,” a soft onslaught that’ll
                                    leave you sobbing in the fetal position: “I need shelter from the rain/To ease the
                                    pain of changing from boys to men.”</p>

                                    <p>It’s one of the weirdest Motown records ever. Marvin Gaye’s divorce
                                        settlement
                                        required him to make two new albums and pay the royalties to his ex-wife –
                                        the
                                        sister of Motown boss Berry Gordy. So Gaye made this bitterly funny double
                                        LP of
                                        breakup songs, including “You Can Leave, But It’s Going to Cost You.” When
                                        he asks
                                        “Somebody tell me please, tell me please/Why do I have to pay attorney
                                        fees?” it’s
                                        one of the most strangely transfixing soul-music moments of all time.</p>

                            <p>Fueled by “a little marijuana and a lotta alienation,” Michigan’s Stooges gave the
                                lie to
                                hippie idealism, playing with a savagery that unsettled even the most blasé
                                clubgoers.
                                Ex-Velvet Underground member John Cale produced a primitive debut wherein, amid Ron
                                Asheton’s wah-wah blurts, Iggy Stooge (né James Osterberg) snarled seminal punk
                                classics
                                such as “I Wanna Be Your Dog,” “No Fun,” and “1969,” bedrock examples of the
                                weaponized
                                boredom that would become a de rigueur punk posture.</p>

    <!-- EXERCISE 2 
            Implement a navigation bar using the bootstrap component
            This navigation bar must link every section in your page
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 3
            Create a responsive section for your favourite albums.
            In this section you should have:
            - 4 albums per row when the screen is very large
            - 3 albums per row when you are on a tablet (or a smaller viewport)
            - 2 albums per row when you are on a small screen
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 4
            Create a section for the album reviews.
            Pick one of your fav albums, and create a section with:
            - Cover
            - Title
            - Band
            - Duration
            - Genre
            - Tracklist
            - ... And whatever you think it's interesting about it!
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 5
            Worst album list! Find out the music you don't really like or you find overrated and list it
            in this "hall of shame" chart!
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 6
            Do you have any musician / band you admire or you are a fan of?
            This section is dedicated to him / her / them!
            Feel free to experiment in this part of the page.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 7
            Just covers!
            Create a tapestry of album pictures. Every album picture must be "square" (use CSS to do that).
            Put at least 20 covers (also repeated) to have a nice effect and see how Bootstrap handles it.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 8
            Implement a footer with some information / social links
        -->

    <!-- ############ EXTRA:
        EXERCISE 9
            Create an album details area that is going to be toggled on and off by clicking on the album image
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 10
            Add a button to each section. By clicking on it the section body appears (if hidden) or disappears (if visible) 
            (hint: look for a boostrap component that can handle the job for you. You can always rely on DOM manipulation if you can't find it)
        -->

    <!--
         EXERCISE 11
            Add in the footer a field that counts, on page load, how many ALBUMS there are on the page 
        -->
